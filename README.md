## Overview

A community-driven faculty directory developed to help students easily find and connect with faculty members at [BUBT](http://bubt.edu.bd)

## üåü Features

- **Effortless Search:**  
  Find faculty members in seconds by searching for their name, faculty code, or email.

- **QR Code Magic:**  
  Generate QR codes for faculty profiles ‚Äì perfect for networking events or quick sharing.

- **vCard Downloads:**  
  Save faculty contact details directly to your phone with a single click.

- **Report Incorrect Info:**

  Clean, modern, and distraction-free. Built to work seamlessly on devices.

- **Admin Dashboard (Coming Soon):**  
  A powerful dashboard to manage user reports, faculty data, update information, and ensure the directory stays up-to-date.


## **üß© Project Structure**
The repository is organized into two main folders, each representing a core part of the project:  

- #### App (SvelteKit)
  The `app` folder contains the fully functional SvelteKit application, including the UI and server-side logics.

- #### Admin (Database Management)  
  The `admin` folder is used to prepare and manage the database. Faculty member data is initially fetched using [BUBT Faculty Scrapper](https://github.com/kurtnettle/bubt-faculty-scraper) and processed here. It also includes plans for an admin dashboard to manage the database.
